# python-berhinger-xtouchmini

Python interface to Berhinger X-Touch Mini.

The structure of the package was copied from [streamdeck](https://github.com/abcminiuser/python-elgato-streamdeck)
which does a similar integration for Elgato Streamdeck devices.

It relies on [mido](https://github.com/mido/mido) for MIDI operations and hardware connection through pyserial.
